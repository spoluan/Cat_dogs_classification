**Project Descriptions**

Cats and dogs are two of the most popular domestic animals and have been a subject of fascination for humans for centuries. They are often kept as pets and are beloved companions to many people around the world. With the advent of modern technology, particularly deep learning and neural networks, it has become possible to harness the power of artificial intelligence to classify and distinguish between cats and dogs automatically.

In this project, we will be utilizing deep learning techniques and basic neural network architecture to tackle the task of classifying cats and dogs. We will be working with a dataset that consists of images of cats and dogs, which will serve as the training and testing data for our model. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify an image as either a cat or a dog based on its visual features.
